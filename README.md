# Default-and-Market-Risk-Assessment-of-Public-US-Companies

# Project Overview
In this project I use daily prices and financial statement data of 50 public U.S companies (continuous constituents of the S&amp;P 500 Index from 2012 to 2022) to create measures in order to assess their exposure to default and market risk over a time horizon of  9 years.

The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and the creation and assessment of robust risk-related financial metrics.
The analysis is performed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

# Datasets
There are 3 datasets used for the analysis:

*The first dataset includes the daily prices of the companies. 
*The second dataset includes financial statements variables and accounting ratios. 
*The third dataset includes equity and debt values of companies. The datasets span from 2012 to 2022.

# Tools and Technologies
*Python (Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
*Jupyter Notebook
