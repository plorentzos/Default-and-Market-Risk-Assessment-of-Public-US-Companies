# Default-and-Market-Risk-Assessment-of-Public-US-Companies

# Project Overview
In this project I use daily prices and financial statement data of 50 public U.S companies (members of the S&amp;P 500 Index) to create measures in order to assess their exposure to default and market risk over a time horizon of  9 years.
The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and the creation and assessment of robust risk-related financial metrics.
